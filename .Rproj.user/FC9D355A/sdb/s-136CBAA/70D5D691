A review of recent 20mph speed zone interventions\"\nauthor: 'null'\noutput: word_document\n---\n\n#Abstract\n\nAt face value the UK has an excellent road safety record in comparison to the rest of Europe. However the UK also has one of the lowest rates for active transport (walking and cycling) in Europe, therefore this skews the results of the nations road safety record. Surveys had suggested the low rate of active transport is a result of the fear of danager that the public have when walking or cyling. In the UK there is currently a growing trend to lower the default urban speed limit from 30 miles per hour (mph) to 20mph in order to improve road safety. The reduced speed limit is also hoped to encourage more people to choose active transport as a result of changing the percieved danger on the roads. Theoretical studies have shown that the 10mph reduction would help to save lives as a result of improved safety with cyclists and pedestrians being the main benefactors. \n\nIn order to test the theory that a reduction in road speed will lead to a lower incident rate amongst cyclists and pedestrians data Road Safety Data provided by the government called stats19 will be analysed before and areas where road speed interventions have taken place. While the accident rate is important to meansure and understand the actual speed of vehicles is also important to measure. Data from cara telemetry systems will also be analysed at the same locations in order to dtermin if there has been a significant reduction in the average traffic speed. ",
